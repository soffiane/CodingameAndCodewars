/**
 * Day 15 : Linked List
 *
 * A Node class is provided for you in the editor. A Node object has an integer data field, DATA , and a Node instance pointer, NEXT ,
 * pointing to another node (i.e.: the next node in a list).
 * A Node insert function is also declared in your editor. It has two parameters: a pointer, HEAD, pointing to the first node of a linked list,
 * and an integer DATA value that must be added to the end of the list as a new Node object.
 *
 * Task
 * Complete the insert function in your editor so that it creates a new Node (pass DATA as the Node constructor argument)
 * and inserts it at the tail of the linked list referenced by the HEAD parameter. Once the new node is added, return the reference to the HEAD node.
 *
 * Note: If the HEAD argument passed to the insert function is null, then the initial list is empty.
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * The insert function has 2 parameters: a pointer to a Node named HEAD, and an integer value, DATA.
 * The constructor for Node has 1 parameter: an integer value for the DATA field.
 *
 * Output Format
 * Your insert function should return a reference to the HEAD node of the linked list.
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * The following input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor:
 * The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
 * The T subsequent lines of test cases each contain an integer to be inserted at the list's tail.
 *
 * 4
 * 2
 * 3
 * 4
 * 1
 * Sample Output
 *
 * The locked code in your editor prints the ordered data values for each element in your list as a single line of space-separated integers:
 *
 * 2 3 4 1
